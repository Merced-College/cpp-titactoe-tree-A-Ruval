It explores possibilities systematically and models decision paths. Trees represent the game's structure, showing branching possibilities and decision paths for each move. The AI is smart at optimizing short-term decisions with minimax and alpha-beta pruning, but its effectiveness is hindered by its depth limit. This limits its ability to think far ahead. If I had more time to improve my code, I would probably go back and try to implement the GUI modification to make my game look more like an actual game. I havenâ€™t worked with SFML yet so I decided against doing this modification as I would probably wind up wasting too much time figuring it out.
